  - title: Dog ORAM - A Distributed and Shared Oblivious RAM Model with Server Side Computation.
    authors: Alexandre Pujol, Christina Thorpe
    conference: IEEE/ACM 8th International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing (UCC 2015).

      Outsourcing to the Cloud is becoming an attractive option for many
      organisations dealing with large amounts of data. However, there is
      still a reluctance amongst companies dealing with highly regulated data
      because traditional Cloud storage does not support the level of privacy
      required to prevent access pattern leakage. Oblivious Random Access
      Machines (ORAM) have been a hot topic of research over the past number of
      years, proposing various cryptographic techniques to obtain the privacy
      levels required. We propose a new model, Dog ORAM â€” a distributed and
      shared oblivious RAM model with server side computation, that merges
      several models existing in the literature and includes a new method of
      access right management for multi-party data access. To achieve this, we
      use an additive homomorphic encryption scheme and a chameleon signature.

  - title: Collecting Metadata on a Instant Messaging Server.
    authors: Alexandre Pujol, Christina Thorpe, Liam Murphy
    conference: 16th European Conference on Cyber Warfare and Security (ECCWS 2017)
    abstract: |
      In this work in progress paper, we worked on metadata leakage in the
      specific use case of an instant messaging server. In a first time, we
      define the different type of metadata that can be found, then in a second
      time, we provide a proof of concept using live forensic method to show how
      we can retrieve leaked metadata on a running server. Then we propose the
      use of an Oblivious RAM model as a solution of this leak.
