### Dog ORAM: A Distributed and Shared Oblivious RAM Model with Server Side Computation.

* Alexandre Pujol, Christina Thorpe
* 2015 IEEE/ACM 8th International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing.

**Abstract**

Outsourcing to the Cloud is becoming an attractive option for many organisations
dealing with large amounts of data. However, there is still a reluctance amongst
companies dealing with highly regulated data because traditional Cloud storage
does not support the level of privacy required to prevent access pattern leakage.
Oblivious Random Access Machines (ORAM) have been a hot topic of research over
the past number of years, proposing various cryptographic techniques to obtain
the privacy levels required. We propose a new model, Dog ORAM â€” a distributed
and shared oblivious RAM model with server side computation, that merges several
models existing in the literature and includes a new method of access right
management for multi-party data access. To achieve this, we use an additive
homomorphic encryption scheme and a chameleon signature.
